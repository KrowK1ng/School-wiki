== General Info ==

- "_virus_" means poison
- made up of *genetic material* and *protein*
- are *infectous* and cause many human diseases
- can live in *every* organism
- reproduce only in a cell
- size from 17nm to 1000nm in diameter

== Virus Structure ==

*Virus particle*
- Covering
	- Capsid (protein)
	- Envelope (not found in all viruses)
- Inner core
	- Nucleic acid molecule (DNA or RNA)
	- Varous proteins (enzymes)

== Virus Shapes ==

* Round virus
* Thread Virus
* Rod Virus
* Bullet virus
* Robot virus (called Bacteriophage)

== Parasitic Nature ==

Viruses:
	- obligate intracellular parasites
	- infect all sort of cells, but are very specific

Example:
	* *Bacteriophage* - infect only bacteria
	* *Tobacco mosaic virus* - infect only plants
	* *Rabies* - infect only mamals

*Note*: Some human viruses even specialize in a particular tissue
	* *HIV* - enters only certain blood cells
	* *Polio virus* - reproduces in spinal nerve cells
	* *Hepatits* - infect only liver cell

== Viral Reproduction ==

_Lytic cycle_ - reproduction occurs, cells burst
_Lysogenic cycle_ - reproduction doesn't occur immediately

*Lytic cycle*
	1) Attachement
		- Capsid combines with receptor
	2) Penetration
		- Viral DNA enters host
	3) Biosynthesis
		- Viral components are syntesized
	4) Maturation
		- Assembly of viral components
	5) Release
		- New viruses leave host cell

*Lysogenic cycle*
	* 2nd Lytic step
	* Integration
		- Viral DNA is integrated into bacterial DNA and is passed on when bacteria reproduce
	* 3rd Lytic step
