== Introduction ==

* They have seeds
* Some plants have nor

=== Plants Structure ===
[[file:plantae/plant-struct.png|>source image]]
* Roots
* Stems
* Leaves
* Flower

== Characteristics ==

- are *multicelular, eukaryotic and autotrophic*
- tissues:
	- plant growth
	- cover and protection
	- support and strength
- lack motility (can't move)
- can grow by cell division
- can adapt

== Vascular Tissue ==

_*Vascular tissue*_ - a systen of tube-like cells that carry materials( water, minerals, food ) throughout a plant

- allow the plant to develop itself better

== Classification ==

Kingdom Plantae			TODO
	- *Has vascular tissue?*
		- No  : [[#Bryophyta|Bryophyta]]
		- Yes : *Has seeds?*

			- Yes

=== Bryophyta ===

- *non vascular* land plants
- small
- grow close to the ground
- are very small in structure
- reproduction process is carried in their *spores*
- play a vital role in *preventing soil erosion*

==== Bryophyta Types ====
[[file:plantae/bryophyta-types.png|>image]]

1) Mosses
	* [[file:plantae/mosses.png|>image]]
	* Most nonvascular plants are mosses
	* They have:
		- Green, leaf-like growths
		- Growths are arranged around a central stalk
		- Rhizods composed of many cells
		- Some stalks with caps are observed in some mosses
		- From these caps are released the spores
	* Can easily be on tree trunks, rocks, old walls or ground
	* Some of mosses are adopted to live in deserts
2) Liverworts _(liver = liver, word = herb)_
	* [[file:plantae/livewarts.png|>image]]
	* Were used in medicine treating *liver illnesses*
	* Are *rootless*
	* Flattened (straigt), leaf-like body
	* Have one-celled rhizoids
3) Hornworts
	* [[file:plantae/hornwarts.png|>image]]
	* *Flattened* body like *liveworts*
	* Their spore-producing structure is like *horn*

=== Pteridophytae ===
[[file:plantae/pteridophytae-types.png|> image]]

- reproduce with *spores* (seedless)
- have *vascular tissues*
- unlike mosses, this plants grow *higher* from soil surface
- water is absorbent from *roots*
- about 1000 species
- the majority are *ferns*
- some species are known only by their *fossils*
- in the past horsetails grew until *15m tall* (today is 2m)

==== Pteridophytae Types ====

1) Ferns
	* [[file:plantae/ferns1.png|> image 1,]][[file:plantae/ferns2.png| image 2]]
	* Have true roots, leaves, stems
	* *No flowers*, but beautiful leaves
	* _*Rhizome*_ - Underground stem (parallel to the ground)
	* _*Sori*_ - Brown spots
	* Spores are released from the _*sori*_
2) Horsetails
	* [[file:plantae/horsetails.png|> image]]
	* *Cange appearance* between spring and summer
	* Have *unique* stem
	* Stem is *jointed*
	* Hollow center surrounder by a *ring of vasculat tissue*
	* At each ring are formed *leaves* around the stem
	* Spores are produced at the tip of cone-like structures (like ground pines and spike mosses)
	* In these plants is found *silicia*, a sabd-like material
	* That's why horsetails are used for *polishing* and *scouring*
3) Club Mosses
	* [[file:plantae/cub-mosses1.png|> image 1,]][[file:plantae/cub-mosses2.png| image 2]]
	* Small mosslike leaves arranged on stem
	* Some have *nongreen spore-bearing leaves* that form a structure called _*cone*_
	* *Ground pines* and *spike mosses* are members of club mosses
	* They are more related to ferns
	* Have needle-like leaves
	* *Spores* are produced at the end of stems
	* Live in various temperatures (from arctic places to hot deserts)

==== Importance of Seedless Plants ====

* The first coal resource
* _*Peat*_ - Decomposed plants, used for fertilization:
	* after plant die, the decaying process is slow because the soil has no oxygen
	* after a long period of time, the decaying plant are transformet into _*peat*_
	* Peat has energy like gas, coal, etc. so it's used as energy source
* House plants
* Keep a good shade
* *Shagnum* mossess are used for gardening
* fearns as weaving material
* Some parts of ferns are eatable: rhizomes, young fronds
* Folk medicine: bee stings, burns, fever and dandruff

=== Gymnosperms ===
[[file:plantae/gymnosperms.png|> image]]

- their seeds develope within a _*cone*_

==== Gymnosperms Types ====

1) Conifers
	* [[file:plantae/conifers.png|> image]]
	* Woody plants(pine, cedar, fir)
	* *Hermaphrodite* : Produce male and female cones on the same tree
2) Cycads
	* [[file:plantae/cycad1.png|> image 1,]][[file:plantae/cycad2.png| image 2]]
	* Tropical trees
	* Large leaves
	* Separate sexes
	* Cones are located at the center of the leaves
3) Ginkgoes
	* [[file:plantae/ginkgoes1.png|> image 1,]][[file:plantae/ginkgoes2.png| image 2]]
	* Found in china
	* Separate sexes

=== Angiosperms ===

- Produce seeds in flowers
- _*Fuits*_ - cover and protect the seed

==== Angiosperms Types ====
[[file:plantae/angiosperms.png|> image]]

|                 | Monocot                                                      | Dicot                                               |
| Flowers         | Flower parts are in multiples of 3                           | Flower parts are in multiples of 4 or 5             |
| Leaves          | have smooth edges and often narrow shape with parallel veins | are oval or plamte(handlike) with netlike veins     |
| Vascular Tissue | Vascular bundles are scatteret in stem                       | Vascular bundles are arranged in a ring around stem |
| Root pattern    | Fibrous root system                                          | Tap root system                                     |
| Embry in seed   | The embry has one cotyledon(seed leaf)                       | The embry has 2 cotyledons                          |

== Flowers Structure ==

[[file:plantae/flower-struct.png|> flower structure]]
TODO add functions of each part

== Pollination ==
[[file:plantae/pollen.png|> image]]

_*Pollination*_ - the process by which pollen is transferred from anther (male) to stigma (female) of the plant
- It enables fertilization and reproduction
- There are 2 types of pollination
	- Self pollination , ex: garden pea
	- Cross pollination , ex: willow
- Pollens are carried by insects, wind, water and even by people

== Growth Period ==

* Annual plant
	- completes its growth period in *1 year*
	- example: Sunflower, Corn, Petunia
* Biennial
	- completes its growth in *2 years*
	- example: Carrot, Onion, Cabbage
* Perennial
	- Grows in years and reproduce many years
	- example: Woody plants (cherry, oak, rose , etc.)
