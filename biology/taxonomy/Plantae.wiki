== Introduction ==

* They have seeds
* Some plants have nor

=== Plants Structure ===
TODO add image
* Roots
* Stems
* Leaves
* Flower

== Characteristics ==

- are *multicelular, eukaryotic and autotrophic*
- tissues:
	- plant growth
	- cover and protection
	- support and strength
- lack motility (can't move)
- can grow by cell division
- can adapt

== Vascular Tissue ==

TODO add image
_*Vascular tissue*_ - a systen of tube-like cells that carry materials( water, minerals, food ) throughout a plant

- allow the plant to develop itself better

== Classification ==

Kingdom Plantae			TODO
	- *Has vascular tissue?*

=== Bryophyta ===

- *non vascular* land plants
- small
- grow close to the ground
- are very small in structure
- reproduction process is carried in their *spores*
- play a vital role in *preventing soil erosion*

==== Bryophyta Classification ====
TODO add image

1) Mosses
	* TODO add image
	* Most nonvascular plants are mosses
	* They have:
		- Green, leaf-like growths
		- Growths are arranged around a central stalk
		- Rhizods composed of many cells
		- Some stalks with caps are observed in some mosses
		- From these caps are released the spores
	* Can easily be on tree trunks, rocks, old walls or ground
	* Some of mosses are adopted to live in deserts
2) Liveworts _(liver = liver, word = herb)_
	* TODO add image
	* Were used in medicine treating *liver illnesses*
	* Are *rootless*
	* Flattened (straigt), leaf-like body
	* Have one-celled rhizoids
3) Hornworts
	* TODO add image
	* *Flattened* body like *liveworts*

=== Pteridophytae ===

- reproduce with *spores* (seedless)
- have *vascular tissues*
- unlike mosses, this plants grow *higher* from soil surface
- water is absorbent from *roots*
- about 1000 species
- the majority are *ferns*
- some species are known only by their *fossils*
- in the past horsetails grew until *15m tall* (today is 2m)
